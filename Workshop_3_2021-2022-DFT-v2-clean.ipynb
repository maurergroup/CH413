    "<b>ASE</b> is a Python package that provides simple workflows for computational chemistry and materials modeling tasks and interfaces with many different DFT software packages. ASE uses Python computer language to define what atoms and molecules are. It defines representations for molecules and materials, allows us to create, visualise, and manipulate them. It is also interfaced with main external DFT and other computational chemistry codes (actually more than 30 codes are currently supported, <a href=\"https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/calculators/calculators.html#module-ase.calculators\"> see this for a full list </a>). Here we will use GPAW among those available interfaces.\n",

It is a Python/C++-based DFT code and can also handle the real-space, and LCAO basis sets (as discussed in Lecture 4). GPAW basis describes the Kohn-Sham DFT wave functions with a basis set that splits the core electrons and the valence electrons. Core electrons are \"frozen\" and described with projector-augmented waves (PAWs) - a formalism that is closely related to the pseudopotentials we discussed in the lecture. The valence electron states are described with a basis set. That basis set in GPAW is usually a uniform real-space grid. Each grid point is a \"basis function\".
